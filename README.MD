# Playing with react without Create-React-App (CRA)  

The purpose of this exercise is to work with react without using the default create react app that allows you to start a react application very quickly. The hope is to be able to understand the technologies used within create react app a bit better. 

## Starting Point  
I will work with a simple index page as a starting point.
